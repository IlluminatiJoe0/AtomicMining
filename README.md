<h2>What is Atomic Mining?</h2>
Atomic Mining is a simple, late game mod that allows you to passively generate ores from their respective atoms using power.
<br><br>

> [!NOTE]
> The Atomic Miner requires power, but this mod does not have a power generation method.

<h2>How to generate ores?</h2>
Craft the Atomic Miner and some atoms of your choice. Place down the Atomic Miner, put one atom into it, and power it. You got infinite ores now!
